<h1>The Life of Page 2.0</h1>

<p>In its infancy, the Web was a document retrieval system, initially meant to
serve static pages linked to each other. When you follow a link or type in the
address bar of the browser, a new page is retrieved from the server and
displayed. But in the world of Web 2.0 and post-Web 2.0 the user experience is
often much different. With the addition of JavaScript, CSS and Ajax
(<code>XMLHttpRequest</code>) pages are now much more like applications, rather
than static documents.</p>

<p>This chapter draws a parallel between the human life and the life of the
contemporary web page (or web application), which we'll call Page 2.0. After
considering the stages of Page 2.0's life, the chapter outlines the
opportunities for speed optimizations in each stage. Further chapters dig into
the details of how exactly to implement these optimizations and create web apps
built for speed.</p>

<h2>The Lifetime</h2>

<p>Let's take a look at the different stages of the life of Page 2.0 as
illustrated in <b>Figure 2.1.</b>  Plotted on the timeline you can see the key
moments of the life of a page and how they correspond to the human life.</p>

</p>

<h3>The Request</h3>

<p>It all starts with the page <em>request</em>. Someone types in a URL or
clicks a link. This is the moment of page's <em>conception</em>. We'll take a
detailed look at what exactly are the requests and how they work in the next
Chapter 3.</p>

<h3>Generating HTML Document</h3>

<p>Next follows the server's "pregnancy" with the page. In the beginning of the
Web this phase simply consisted of server software looking for the requested
static document (HTML file) on the hard drive and reading its contents. But
things are more complicated now when most of the web sites use a server-side
programming language, such as PHP, Ruby, Python, Perl, to assemble the resulting
document dynamically.</p>

<p>The server-side program (often called a <em>server-side script</em>) first
fetches data from somewhere, usually from a database or from web service calls
to other servers. Then it crunches that data stitching together a string of HTML
code, which is the new dynamically generated document.</p>

<p>In this book we'll not worry about optimizing this part because, as we'll
see, this is not where most of the time is usually spent.</p>

<h3>The Response</h3>

<p>Luckily if there are no complications, such as abortions or 404 Not Found
pages, the pregnancy is over, and the <em>HTML document is sent</em> to the
browser with the so-called HTTP response.</p>

<p>The Page 2.0 is officially <em>born</em>.</p>

<h3>Waterfall</h3>

<p>Then comes the <em>waterfall</em> phase when the browser downloads all the
extra page components required by the page - images, scripts, styles... This
phase ends with the onload event which the browsers fire after all components
referred to in the HTML document are downloaded. This phase roughly corresponds
to the <em>childhood</em> and teen years of our little human, which eventually
<em>graduates</em> and becomes Ms. Page. The waterfall is the most important
phase with regards to speed optimization. A major part of the book, starting
with Chapter 3 is dedicated to optimizing this phase.</p>

<h3>Settling Down</h3>

<p>Right after <code>onload</code> comes a phase of <em>settling down</em> when
the young Ms. Page is still in search for her true self and identity. In
technical terms this is the phase when JavaScript kicks in and starts performing
some initialization work such as attaching event handlers to DOM elements,
progressive enhancements, and maybe fetching a few more components or getting
some additional data via Ajax calls.</p>

<p>The page then eventually settles down. The status bar stops showing URLs that
are being downloaded, browser indicators stop spinning, the cursor is no longer
showing a busy icon and the user gets the full interaction experience. You might
say that the young adult is back from backpacking across Western Europe and
Tibet and ready to get married, find a stable job and even own a barbecue
grill.</p>

<h3>User Interactions</h3>

<p>Then life goes on, user interacts with the page. Some pages are mostly static
and quite uneventful, for example a news article or a blog post, where the most
exciting thing that happens is the occasional ad rotation. Others (think a
webmail inbox) are full of ups and downs (uploads/downloads), always getting
more data, updating and self-improving, always on the move.</p>

<h3>Next Request</h3>

<p>Sooner or later along comes the next request to end it all. The user clicks
away from the page, making a new request and our Page is laid to rest after the
browser has fired the <code>onunload</code> event.</p>

<h2>When Is a Page Done?</h2>

<p>While onload is a concrete event which should signify when the page is ready,
it's not always that simple. Just like in real life it is not quite clear when
someone has reached maturity, if ever. The "user onload" is an undefined point
in time that could happen before the <code>onload</code> or way after
(<b>Figure 2.2</b>). It all depends on the type of page or application and also
on the user.</p>

<p>
  <img src="../images/02.02.user-onload.png"> <div class="caption"><em>Figure
  2.2.</em> "user onload" varies from one page to the next and from one user to
  the next  </div>
</p>

<p>An article page could be considered ready when the article title and content
are ready. The user can read and therefore interact with the page, while images
and ads are still being downloaded. Other times the onload may happen relatively
quickly, but the actual page content is still being retrieved and the page is
far from usable, hardly anything more than a splash screen shown (probably with
the word "Loading..." accompanied by a spinning wheel animation) while the
actual content is still to come.</p>

<p>It also depends on the type of user, because some users will wait for the
page to stop moving and shifting, and stand completely still. Others will scroll
almost immediately, as soon as something shows up, which is a reflex in an
answer to the fact that the top of the page often contains a banner ad or is
simply the site's static header containing logo and navigation.</p>

<p>It's up to you to figure out when is the "user onload" for your type of page
and your type of user. In the lack of a better definition of user onload, the
page <code>onload</code> event or the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> are often a
good approximation for performance measurement purposes.</p>

<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>

<p>Now that we've identified the most important phases of a page's lifetime,
let's explore, at a high level, what we can do to speed up each of those
phases.</p>

<p>Probably the first and most important place for optimization for most pages
is the waterfall stage because that's where usually the time is spent. However,
you can optimize the page in any of the other stages too. It's important to
identify where the bottlenecks of a specific page are, then prioritize and focus
on the areas where you'll see the greatest benefit.</p>

<p>Below is a summary of the main optimization activities in each stage. Don't
worry if some of these sound like a foreign language, they are described in
details throughout the rest of the book.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Optimizations at <em>request time</em>, which include for example reducing
  the size of the requests by sending requests with fewer cookies or no cookies
  at all for static page components, such as images.</li> <li>Optimizing the
  <em>waterfall</em> which can be divided into the following categories:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fewer page components</strong>: it's obvious that your
      waterfall will be shorter when there are fewer items in it. In Chapter 3
      you'll read about reducing the number of HTTP requests, merging
      components, using CSS sprites, using data URIs and MHTML, caching and
      implementing "never expires" policy to improve repeat visits, removing
      duplicates, near duplicates, and plain old 404 Page Not Found errors. In
      order to reduce the number of components you can also remove the ones that
      you don't need immediately and load them at the next stage of life - after
      onload (this is a technique known as lazy-loading)</li>
      <li><strong>Smaller components</strong>: once you've removed or merged
      components, the ones that are left should be as small as they can be.
      This means using compression, minification, zero body 204 components
      (these techniques are described in Chapter 4) and optimizing images
      (Chapter 5)</li> <li><strong>Move out of the way</strong>: some components
      in the waterfall harm more than others and not everything happens in
      parallel. Loading components in parallel is good because more components
      are downloaded at the same time and the waterfall finishes earlier.
      Chapter 6 discusses non-blocking JavaScripts and CSS, as well as reducing
      the number of DNS lookups redirects.</li> <li>If the waterfalls
      <strong>start early</strong> they will finish early. Chapter 9 describes
      flushing and HTTP chunked encoding to start the waterfall even before the
      page is born. (If you know it's going to be a baby girl, you can start
      hoarding the stuff in the pink color scheme)</li>
    </ul>
  </li> <li>Optimizing the after-<code>onload</code> phase: you can help here
  too. For example, you can start some of the JavaScript initialization work
  after the  <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event fires, you don't always need to
  wait for <code>onload</code>.</li> <li>The <em>interactive</em> phase (the
  adult life phase) optimizations include tweaking CSS and JavaScript
  performance to make sure your user interactions are smoother, more pleasant,
  and the UI is responsive (Chapters 7 and 8)</li> <li>Towards the
  <em>end-of-life</em> you can help too. The old tired page can leave a good
  inheritance by preloading some of the components that the children and
  grandchildren pages may need and speeding them up in advance.</li>
</ul>
