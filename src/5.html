<h1>Optimizing Images</h1>

<p>In the previous chapter we talked about reducing the file sizes of most
common file types used on the web except for images. Let's tackle images now.

<p>In this chapter you will learn about lossless image optimizations that you
can perform on the three common image types used on the web: PNG, JPEG, GIF.
You'll also learn about the two major types of PNG: palette (PNG8) and truecolor
(PNG24) and see why PNG8 should always be preferred instead of GIF.

<p>Images are an important part of most web pages. Even though we now see
increasingly more JavaScript-heavy fat-client web applications, the weight of
the images still contributes 40-50% of the total page weight on average. This
means that reducing image file sizes helps significantly towards achieving the
goal of serving fast pages.

<h2>Lossless Optimization</h2>

<p>Image optimization is usually done by hand by skilled designers who carefully
choose the image quality settings, crop only the relevant parts of an image and
so on. These are all subjective optimizations; they require human touch and
human eye verification. Let's not talk about these types of optimizations and
focus on the lossless optimizations instead. <em>Lossless optimizations</em> are
those that take an image and produce another image, which renders exactly the
same on the screen as the original, pixel by pixel. Only it's smaller in file
size.

<p>The lossless file size savings come from:

<ul>
  <li>Using better compression algorithms to store the pixel information
  <li>Removing unneeded metadata that goes with the image file
</ul>

<p>In this chapter you'll see that there are a number of free, cross-platform,
open-source tools that perform lossless optimizations. Almost all of these tools
can run on the command line, which means that you can create a simple script
that does all the optimizations for you, picking the right tool for the right
file format. You can safely automate this process and not worry about the visual
results. You don't need to look at the optimized images, because they will look
exactly the same as the originals.

<h2>Image Formats</h2>

<p>On the web we mainly deal with JPEGs, GIFs (some of them animated), and PNGs.
The PNG format also comes in two main variations - PNG8 (a.k.a. <em>palette</em>
or <em>indexed</em> PNG) and PNG24 (a.k.a. <em>truecolor</em> or
<em>PNG32</em>). PNG8 has all of the features of GIF plus more (and minus
animation) and it almost always yields a smaller file size. There is no reason
to use GIF anymore; you should convert all non-animated GIFs to PNG8 and benefit
from the file size savings.

<p>Let's take a look at the tools available for losslessly optimizing each of
the image formats: GIF, JPEG, and PNG.

<h2>Optimizing GIF</h2>

<p>The best way to optimize a GIF image is to convert it to PNG, more
specifically PNG8. PNG8 is a palette image format, just like GIF. It can store
up to 256 colors, just like GIF. In addition, PNG8 supports full alpha
transparency, which is a little known fact, mainly because of the lack of
support among image editing software, such as Photoshop. This is actually worth
repeating.

<p>PNG8 supports alpha transparency, although most image editing programs don't
give you that option.

<p>When using "Save for Web & Devices", Photoshop offers you to export to, among
others, PNG8 and GIF. In both cases Photoshop only allows you to select one
color of the palette and make it fully transparent. All others are fully opaque.
This is actually what GIF supports, but PNG8 can do better. GIF supports
<em>binary transparency</em>, meaning that a single pixel is either fully
transparent or fully opaque. PNG8 supports <em>alpha transparency</em> meaning
that a pixel can be only partially transparent and whatever is underneath the
image can shine through.

<p>In any case, even in Photoshop, PNG8 is at least as good as GIF. There's also
no issue with IE6's support for fully transparent pixels in PNG8.

<p>PNG8 almost always yield smaller file sizes. Exceptions are rare and only
when an image is really small and contains just a few colors. So in terms of
performance optimization <strong>all GIFs should be converted to PNG8</strong>.

<p>This may sound like a lot of work, but there are tools to help you automate
the process. One such tool is OptiPNG. It's a command-line tool that you can run
on all operating systems like so:

<pre>$ optipng *.gif</pre>

<p>This command will convert all GIFs in the current directory to PNG. If you
want to be extra careful, you can write a short script that checks whether the
result is indeed smaller and if not, keep the GIF. But in general converting all
will be better in nearly all cases.

<div class="sidebar"><h4>PNG is smaller</h4>

<p>A common misconception is that GIF is smaller than PNG. This myth is based on
observations when exporting a PSD (PhotoShop Document) as a PNG and then GIF.
The problem is that in most cases people compare a color-rich graphic exported
as a <strong>truecolor</strong> PNG (with potentially millions of colors) versus
the greatly reduced 256-color only GIF. Often the human eye cannot distinguish
when a graphic is missing thousands of colors if they are subtle enough. The
proper apples-to-apples comparison is PNG8 vs. GIF in which cases PNG8 is pretty
much always the winner especially after proper optimization (discussed
below).</p></div>

<h3>Animated GIFs</h3>

<p>You should convert all GIFs to PNG except for the animated GIFs. Although
there are PNG options for animations, most notably the APNG format, they are not
yet widely supported. So for simple "loading..." and other animations, you can
keep the GIFs, but optimize them.

<p>A tool called GIFSicle is a free option. You run it on the command line like:

<pre>$ gifsicle -O2 before.gif &gt; after.gif</pre>

<p>This tool optimizes the images, by not carrying over duplicate pixels from
one animation frame to another and optimizing the palette used in each frame.
Note that the option -O2 has a capitalized letter O (for <em>optimize</em>), not
the number 0.

<h2>Optimizing JPEG</h2>

<p>While PNG and GIF are more suitable for decoration graphics, buttons and CSS
sprites, JPEG is the right format for photos and other images that contain many
colors and gradual transitions of color (not sharp lines and text).

<p>JPEG is a <em>lossy</em> format, meaning that every time you open a JPEG and
save it, you'll lose some image information, even if you use the maximum quality
setting of 100. But luckily, there are some operations that can be performed
losslessly, such as:

<ul>
  <li>Editing image metadata <li>Optimizing compression <li>Switching from
  progressive to baseline format <li>Cropping <li>Rotation to 90, 180, 270
  degrees
</ul>

<p>For performance purposes, we'll be looking only into the first three
operations. A tool that allows you to perform the lossless operations is called
JPEGTran.

<p>The image meta data contains information such as the author of the photo,
copyrights, date, time, geolocation the photo was taken and so on. You can see
how some of this information may be useful and even required. But for the
purposes of viewing the image in a browser as part of a web page, much of that
data is not needed. Additionally there's a lot of extra data that your users
have no use for, data you didn't even intend to include, such as image software
internal data, thumbnails of the actual image within the image and even audio.
Why send all these extra bytes and slow down the user experience, when this
information will never be used?

<p>With JPEGTran you can strip all the meta information from an image. Other
software, such as EXIFTool offer fine-grained control over the specific meta
fields, while JPEGTran takes an all or nothing approach. The option -copy none
in JPEGTran strips all meta data, the option -copy all keeps it intact.

<h3>Observing the intellectual property</h3>

<p>Before stripping all meta information from an image, make sure you own the
rights to that image (e.g. you took the photo yourself). Removing photographer
name and copyright information is illegal.

<p>In addition to stripping meta data, you can optimize the compression used to
store the pixel information using the -optimize option. This is a good practice
because many image editors don't write optimized JPEGs. Instead of -optimize,
you can use -progressive option which creates progressively loading JPEGs
(discussed below).

<p>So the command you need to run on all JPEGs before publishing them on the web
looks like so:

<pre>$ jpegtran -copy none -optimize before.jpg &gt; after.jpg</pre>

<p>Again, substitute -copy none with -copy all if you need to retain all meta
data and substitute -optimize with -progressive when you want a progressive
JPEG.

<h3>Progressive JPEG</h3>

<p>The so-called <em>baseline JPEGs</em> load from top to bottom as the image
arrives over the network (<b>Figure 5.1</b>). The <em>progressive JPEGs</em>
load from low quality to high in several "passes" (<b>Figure 5.2</b>)

<p>
  <img src="../images/05.01.progressive base.png"> <div
  class="caption"><em>Figure 5.1.</em> Baseline JPEG loads from top to
  bottom</div>
</p>

<p>
  <img src="../images/05.02.progressive example.png"> <div
  class="caption"><em>Figure 5.2.</em> Progressive JPEG loading from low quality
  to high</div>
</p>

<p>A common understanding is that progressive formats produce larger files.
While this seems to be true for GIF and PNG, it doesn't look so clear-cut for
JPEGs.

<p>In a study of over 10000 JPEGs from all over the web, I found that results
vary from one image to the next. But plotting a trendline (<b>Figure 5.3.</b>)
shows that <strong>images of file size 10K and over have a better chance of
being smaller when using the progressive JPEG format</strong>. The difference
could be up to 10% (with 3% median) but in extreme cases that translated to 250K
of savings.

<p>
  <img src="../images/05.03.progressive.png"> <div class="caption"><em>Figure
  5.3.</em> Trendline showing the difference between progressive and baseline
  codings. X-axis shows the original image file size, and Y shows the difference
  when subtracting progressive from baseline sizes</div>
</p>

<p>Since this is just a trend and not applicable to all images, if you're
focused on producing the smallest size possible, you can try both formats and
pick the smaller result. Otherwise you can simply establish a general of thumb:
baseline for thumbnails, progressive for the actual photos.

<h3>Old School, New School</h3>

<p>It's not common to see photos on the web that render the way progressive
JPEGs do, because the majority of the JPEGs use baseline coding (the power of
the defaults in action). This may cause some web professionals to dismiss the
progressive JPEGs as looking too old school. But on the other hand iPhone always
renders all photos like progressively coded JPEGs, from low resolution to
higher. So we can speculate that in the future people may become more and more
familiar with this visual pattern and even expect it.

<h2>Optimizing PNG</h2>

<p>Most image editing programs don't write properly optimized PNG files.
Luckily, there are many free tools to remedy the situation. Some of the tools
strip the so-called PNG chunks and some offer better compression of the pixel
data. Many do both. Since the different tools provide different results by each
doing its own thing, for best savings you can run as many tools as you can, one
on the result of the previous. Naturally, this will slow down the optimization
process and in fact the benefits diminish with each additional tool. So unless
you're really motivated to produce the smallest results, running just one the
tools would be enough and often significantly reduce the size of the file
produced by the image program.

<h3>Chunks</h3>

<p>PNG is an extensible image format, which allows feature extensions to be
implemented and stored in "chunks". Image software that doesn't understand a
certain chunk can simply ignore it and still be able to work with the image. For
the purposes of displaying images in a web page, most of the chunks can be
stripped; they are not needed and in fact can be dangerous. For example a gamma
correction chunk aims to solve the problem of inconsistent display of colors in
different operating systems, but in fact introduces inconsistency between a
color value in PNG and the same color in CSS in some browsers. Removing the
gamma correction chunk solves this problem.

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>Let's see some of the PNG optimization tools and their options.

<h4>PNGCrush</h4>

<p>PNGCrush removes unneeded chunks and tries different compression methods. It
can be run like so:

<pre>$ pngcrush -rem alla -reduce before.png after.png</pre>

<p>The option -rem alla removes all chunks except for transparency. If you want
to retain all chunks, use -rem none. You can also pick and choose individual
chunks to preserve. An additional option -brute makes more attempts to optimize
compression resulting in slower but even better optimization.

<h4>OptiPNG</h4>

<p>OptiPNG is also a command-line tool, but it has several GUI versions for both
PC and Mac. As you saw with the GIF conversion, you can simply be run it like:

<pre>$ opting *.gif</pre>

<p>or

<pre>$ optipng *.png</pre>

<p>OptiPNG has seven levels of optimization, which you can specify using the -o
option, like so:

<pre>$ optipng -o7 before.png -out after.png</pre>

<p>Option -o7 means best (slowest) compression and two (option -o2) is the
default.

<h4>PNGOptimizer</h4>

<p>This tool is Windows-only, it has a GUI and command-line versions:

<pre>$ pngoptimizercl -file:"image.png"</pre>

<p>Or to optimize in bulk:

<pre>$ pngoptimizercl -file:"*.png"</pre>

<h4>PNGOut</h4>

<p>PNGOut is closed source, has a paid Windows GUI and free command-line
binaries for Windows, Mac, Linux. By default PNGOut uses the best (slowest)
compression:

<pre>$ pngout image.png</pre>

<p>If you want faster optimization you can select a strategy from 0 (best) to 5
(no compression). You can also specify a different filename for the result if
needed:

<pre>$ pngout -s2 before.png after.png</pre>

<h4>AdvPNG</h4>

<p>Setting for best compression:

<pre>$ advpng -z4 image.png</pre>

<h4>DelfOpt</h4>

<p>Windows-only binary, closed source, usually the last tool to run when running
several tools in succession:

<pre>$ deflopt *.png</pre>

<p>One final tool worth mentioning is <strong>PNGSlim</strong>. It's actually a
Windows .bat file, which runs most of the other tools in the list above with
different options. It's therefore the slowest (since it runs all others) but
produces the smallest sizes possible.

<p>The list of available PNG optimizations may look overwhelming, but it's given
here mostly if you want to invest the time to build your own image optimization
script with the best results. Otherwise, just running one of the tools will be a
significant improvement over not optimizing at all. How significant? Let's see.

<h2>Optimizing the Top 1000 Sites</h2>

<p>So far you learned about the ways to reduce file sizes losslessly for each
type of image. To summarize:

<ol>
  <li>Convert GIFs to PNG <li>Run all PNGs though any (or all) of the available
  PNG optimization tools <li>Run JPEGTran on all JPEGs <li>Optimize animations
  with GIFSicle
</ol>

<p>Now let's see what will happen if you follow these guidelines and optimize
all the images found on the top 1000 websites in the world. Have in mind that
these are the top high-traffic sites, which means that they should probably be
well optimized or at least better than the average website.

<p>The survey of the top 1000 was provoked by the curiosity as to how widespread
is the superior PNG format, compared to the old GIF. Turns out that GIFs are
still predominantly used (<b>Figure 5.4.</b>), despite the fact that PNG specs
have been released 14 years ago and the modern browsers support the format (the
transparency issue in IE6 is addressed in the next section of this chapter)

<p>
  <img src="../images/05.04.top1000.png"> <div class="caption"><em>Figure
  5.4.</em> "Market" share of the image formats found on top 1000 sites (May
  2010)</div>
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Now that we know the distribution, the question is: are the images optimized
and can we do better?

<h4>GIF to PNG</h4>

<p>Converting all GIFs to PNG resulted in significant savings -
<strong>23.79%</strong>. This is obviously a lot of bandwidth to gain. The
process of converting is quick and painless; it only takes about 1 minute per
1000 images. For this experiment I ran the tools OptiPNG and PNGOptimizer like
so:

<pre>$ optipng *.gif</pre>

<pre>$ pngoptimizercl -file:"*.png"</pre>

<h4>Optimizing PNG</h4>

<p>As you can see, converting all GIFs to PNG is a clear win. But what about the
images that are already PNG, are they optimized?

<p>Turns out that simply running all PNGs through a single tool - PNGOptimizer -
gives <strong>16.90%</strong> savings. Not bad at all given that all it took was
running one command:

<pre>$ pngoptimizercl -file:"*.png"</pre>

<p>The results could be even better if you run several tools with different
options, in addition to PNGOptimizer.

<h4>Optimizing JPEG</h4>

<p>Running all JPEGs through JPEGTran resulted in <strong>13.08%</strong>
savings, using the command:

<pre>$ jpegtran -copy none -outfile destination.jpg -optimize source.jpg</pre>

<p>Again, you can do better by trying progressive encoding and picking the
smaller result.

<h4>GIF animations</h4>

<p>Running GIFSicle on all GIF animation was able to shave <strong>4.6%</strong>
off the file sizes. The savings are not as pronounced as the other image types,
but every little bit helps, especially if the process is automated and doesn't
require any manual effort.

<h2>PNG and Alpha Transparency</h2>

<p>A well-known issue exists in the way IE6 handles transparency in
<em>truecolor</em> PNGs (PNG24). Some of the transparent areas become a flat
color, usually grey (<b>Figure 5.5.</b>). This is solved using IE's proprietary
CSS filter called AlphaImageLoader.

<p>
  <img src="../images/05.05.png"> <div class="caption"><em>Figure 5.5.</em>
  Truecolor PNG transparency in modern browsers (left) versus IE6 (right)</div>
</p>

<p>If you need an alpha transparent truecolor PNG as a background, you can use
the underscore CSS hack to target only IE6, unset the background and provide the
filter declaration:</p>

<div class="hl-main"><pre><span class="hl-identifier">.classname</span><span class="hl-code"> </span><span class="hl-brackets">{</span><span class="hl-code">
  </span><span class="hl-reserved">background:</span><span class="hl-code"> </span><span class="hl-code">url</span><span class="hl-code">(</span><span class="hl-code">image</span><span class="hl-code">.</span><span class="hl-code">png</span><span class="hl-code">)</span><span class="hl-reserved"></span><span class="hl-code">;
  _</span><span class="hl-reserved">background:</span><span class="hl-code"> </span><span class="hl-string">none</span><span class="hl-reserved"></span><span class="hl-code">;
  _</span><span class="hl-reserved">filter:</span><span class="hl-code">progid</span><span class="hl-code">:</span><span class="hl-code">DXImageTransform</span><span class="hl-code">.</span><span class="hl-code">Microsoft</span><span class="hl-code">.</span><span class="hl-code">AlphaImageLoader</span><span class="hl-code">
                          (</span><span class="hl-code">src</span><span class="hl-code">='</span><span class="hl-code">image</span><span class="hl-code">.</span><span class="hl-code">png</span><span class="hl-code">', </span><span class="hl-code">sizingMethod</span><span class="hl-code">='</span><span class="hl-string">crop</span><span class="hl-code">')</span><span class="hl-reserved"></span><span class="hl-code">;
</span><span class="hl-brackets">}</span></pre></div>

<p>Another solution to the problem involves the use of VML (Vector Markup
Language) and is a little more complicated.

<p>There also exist a number of solutions (usually called "pngfix") that
automatically solve the problem for you using JavaScript and commonly an .htc
file. HTC stands for HTML Components and is a non-standard extension by
Microsoft. The pngfix solutions are convenient since they use JavaScript to
generate the filter or the VML code without you having to do complex work in CSS
or HTML.

<p>There are several problems with those solutions:

<ul>
  <li>The AlphaImageLoader hurts performance. It makes the page slower (27 times
  slower for a test page with 100 images), consumes a lot more memory (78 times
  more) and blocks the progressive page display by locking the browser. In cases
  when the image download gets delayed (it happens, the network is
  unpredictable), the browser is frozen and doesn't even allow canceling the
  page load or typing in the address bar. This is a bad user experience (one of
  the worst actually), so AlphaImageLoader should be avoided if at all possible.
  <li>Solutions that use .htc files add another HTTP component to the waterfall
  and therefore make the page slower. An .htc file solution that uses
  AlphaImageLoader is the worst for performance purposes.  <li>Solutions that
  use JavaScript which generates the required VML are the least bad, because the
  JavaScript may be combined with your own scripts (no additional HTTP
  components) and the VML solution doesn't freeze the browser or eat memory like
  the AlphaImageLoader does.
</ul>

<p>To summarize - avoid AlphaImageLoader and transparent truecolor PNGs. Try to
work with a different design or use a PNG8 alpha transparent image. If all else
fails, use a PNG fix script that doesn't introduce a new HTTP component to
download and uses a VML solution to transparency.

<h3>PNG8 and Alpha Transparency</h3>

<p>As already mentioned, despite the lack of image editing software support,
PNG8 does offer alpha transparency and it's supported across all modern
browsers. IE6 is again an exception, but not as bad as the PNG24 alpha
transparency.

<p>In IE6, all partially transparent pixels in a PNG8 image become fully
transparent. In other words, <strong>in IE6 PNG8 behaves like a GIF</strong>.

<p>Sometimes designers use a truecolor PNG for all browsers, but provide a
separate GIF for IE6. This is not an ideal solution, because it creates
maintenance issues (maintaining two images) and you can actually use a single
PNG8 to support all browsers.

<p>All you need to do is create a <em>progressively enhanced PNG8</em> - one
that looks OK when viewed in IE6 (looks like a GIF) and gets progressively
better in the modern browsers (<b>Figure 5.6.</b>)


<p>
  <img src="../images/05.06.png"> <div class="caption"><em>Figure 5.6.</em> A
  progressively enhanced PNG8 which displays as desired in modern browsers
  (left) and degrades to a GIF-like binary transparency in IE6 (right)</div>
</p>

<h3>Progressive Enhancement with PNG8</h3>

<p>There are tools that take a truecolor PNG24 image and convert it to a PNG8.
In this process the tools might reduce the number of colors if the original
contains more than 256 colors. After this conversion the PNG8 will behave as
expected in all browsers and degrade to a GIF-like in IE6. However, automatic
conversion might not always create gracefully degraded GIF-like experience.
You'll need to edit the image by hand to make sure that after IE6 drops all
semi-transparent pixels and displays them as fully transparent, the image still
looks acceptable using solid opaque pixels only.

<p class="sidebar">Fireworks is one notable exception among image editing
software that does offer you to use alpha transparency in PNG8.</p>

<p>Let's see a recipe of using Photopshop to create a truecolor alpha
transparent PNG24 in a way that will allow you to convert it to a progressively
enhanced PNG8 using the command line tool PNGQuant. The end result is the image
shown on <b>Figure 5.6.</b>

<p>First, you create a button-like rounded corner rectangle using Photoshop's
rectangle tool. We'll keep this in a layer called "Original" (<b>Figure
5.7.</b>). This layer will have 99% opacity, which effectively hides it
completely from IE6.

<p>
  <img src="../images/05.07.png8 1 original.png"> <div
  class="caption"><em>Figure 5.7.</em> Using rectangle tool gives you a nicely
  rounded box</div>
</p>

<p>Since we want to use the same button on top of different colors, we cannot
use a GIF, because it will contain a few almost white pixels around the edges.
So we copy the "Original" layer into a new one (named "Solid", <b>Figure
5.8.</b>) and use the mountain tops technique to make the rounded corners look
acceptable even when using a single solid color. This is the way IE6 will see
the end result. It's convenient to keep this as a separate layer, so that in
Photoshop you can toggle layer visibility and preview the end result in IE6 and
in all other browsers.

<p>
  <img src="../images/05.08.png8 2 solid.png"> <div class="caption"><em>Figure
  5.8.</em> Mountain tops technique to make the rounded corner look acceptable
  using a single solid color</div>
</p>

<p>Finally, we add another layer with 99% opacity (to hide it from IE6) which
adds the yellowish glow (<b>Figure 5.9.</b>).

<p>
  <img src="../images/05.09.png8 3 glow.png"> <div class="caption"><em>Figure
  5.9.</em> Glow around the button in a new layer with 99% opacity</div>
</p>

<p>Now, using "Save for Web and Devices" you can export this image as a PNG24
and then convert it to PNG8 using PNGQuant:

<pre>$ pngquant 256 button.png</pre>

<p>This command sets the max number of colors to 256 and produces an alpha
transparent PNG8 in a file called button-fs.png.

<p>The result PNG8 image will behave the same as the PNG24 original in all
browsers, and will look like the "Solid" layer with a binary transparency in
IE6. This is because the other two layers have 99% opacity which IE6 will treat
as 0% opacity (fully transparent).

<p class="sidebar">In addition to PNGQuant, other tools that can convert
truecolor PNG24 to indexed PNG8 are PNGNQ and PNGRewrite. PNGNQ, like PNGQuant
will reduce the number of colors to fit the 256 limit of the indexed image
format. PNGRewrite will only convert (and optimize) images under 256 colors and
give up on the others.</p>

<h3>Reusable Images</h3>

<p>As you know, the best way to speed up a page is to have fewer page
components. One way to get better at this is to use the same image for various
purposes. Let's see a technique that allows you to put a background image over
different background colors and have different results.

<p>One example of the technique is shown on <b>Figure 5.10.</b> The background
color in this example is different for each button (and changed on hover), but
the background image that creates the glossy effect is the same.

<p>
  <img src="../images/05.10.iphone buttons.png"> <div class="caption"><em>Figure
  5.10.</em> iPhone-like glossy buttons sharing the same background image and
  using different background colors</div>
</p>

<p>The background image is a PNG8, 1px wide by 1000px high (just to be safe) and
is repeated horizontally in CSS. The upper 500px (half the image) is partially
transparent, while the bottom 500px is fully transparent.

<p>The HTML:</p>

<div class="hl-main"><pre><span class="hl-brackets">&lt;</span><span class="hl-reserved">p</span><span class="hl-code"> </span><span class="hl-var">class</span><span class="hl-code">=</span><span class="hl-quotes">&quot;</span><span class="hl-string">button</span><span class="hl-quotes">&quot;</span><span class="hl-brackets">&gt;</span><span class="hl-code">button1</span><span class="hl-brackets">&lt;/</span><span class="hl-reserved">p</span><span class="hl-brackets">&gt;</span><span class="hl-code">

<p>As you can see, you can reuse the same image and create any number of
colorful buttons. This can be especially useful for themes and social profile
customizations, which allow the user to pick any color.

<p>In IE6 the whole PNG8 image will appear fully transparent, so the glossy
effect will degrade to the solid background color.

<p>Additional optimization is to use data URIs (from Chapter 3) to inline the
image, since 1x1000 image is only about 100 bytes. This way you avoid the HTTP
request altogether at the price of degrading the IE7 experience to IE6-like,
since IE7 doesn't support data URIs.

<p>Another example of reusing the same image is shown on <b>Figure 5.11.</b> A
tiny background image contains diagonal stripes made of semi-transparent and
fully transparent lines. Using such image on top of different colors, allows you
to reuse the image (<b>Figure 5.11</b>, <b>Figure 5.12</b>)

<p>
  <img src="../images/05.11.stripes.png"> <div class="caption"><em>Figure
  5.11.</em> Same background image on top of different solid colors</div>
</p>

<p>
  <img src="../images/05.12.twitter.png"> <div class="caption"><em>Figure
  5.12.</em> Same background image, uploaded to Twitter as a profile
  background</div>
</p>

<p>Yet another example of reusable images is to create a gradient image, but one
that changes transparency (not color) gradually. Using this image as a
background on top of solid color will help you create any gradient with a single
image. In fact this image will be about the same file size as if you use CSS3,
-moz, -webkit, and two filter declarations (one for IE8 and one IE &lt; 8) for
creating cross-browser image-less gradients in CSS.

<h2>Optimizing favicons</h2>

<p>The little favicon.ico files that sit in the root of your website may be a
source of inefficiencies too. Sometimes you simply forget them because,
technically, they are not part of the page. When you forget them, the browsers
will still request them and your server will reply with a 404 Not Found page.
Sites often have complex 404 pages, which query data and try to guess what the
person might have had in mind when they came across the dead page. In case of
missing favicons, all that work to create a 404 page is a waste, since it's
never displayed or used. So keep in mind to always have a favicon.

<p>
  <img src="../images/05.13.ysearch.png"> <div class="caption"><em>Figure
  5.13.</em> Yahoo! favicon - 318 bytes, 16 colors</div>
</p>

<p>Favicons are usually small, around a little over 1K. This is a good file size
to aim at. If possible, don't go overboard with big icons and animations. As
discussed in the previous chapter it also makes sense to send the favicon with
gzip encoding, especially if it's bigger in size.

<p>If you want to have a really tiny favicon (318 bytes) you can keep it under
16 colors. Converting an existing icon to one that only has 16 colors can be
done on the command line, using ImageMagick's convert utility:

<pre>$ convert -colors 16 someimage.png favicon.ico</pre>

<p>This is, of course, a lossy operation (since colors are reduced) so the
result should be checked visually.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The savings from lossless optimizations may vary from one image to the next,
but these optimizations are easy to do, easy to automate and risk-free.
Therefore you should never put an image on your web site that comes directly
from image editing software without running it through an optimization tool.

The four basic steps at image size reduction are:

<ol>
  <li>Convert all GIFs to PNG <li>Run GIFSicle of animations <li>Run JPEGTran on
  photos <li>Run any PNG tool on PNGs
</ol>

<p>Just remembering (or automating) these four steps will have you well on the
way to a leaner site.

<p>If you can invest more time in image optimization, you should:

<ul>
  <li>Learn to love alpha transparent PNG8, which will let you move away from
  AlphaImageLoader and even further away from any GIFs <li>Consider reusable
  image techniques, which will allow you to create fast-loading and highly
  customizable pages and profiles without generating new graphics for each color
  preference <li>And finally, try to come up with a favicon.ico that fits into
  16 colors
</ul>
