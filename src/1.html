<h1>The Performance Business Case</h1>

<p>No one likes to wait and we all hate slow pages. These are obvious, easily
observable facts that don't need any proof. And, as you'll see later in Chapter
9, which discusses the psychology of time and speed, waiting affects users in
negative ways not only psychologically (they distrust the site, perceive it as
lower quality) but also physiologically (they get irritable, their blood
pressure increases). In the end, all the negative effects of slow web sites add
up to a loss of users, loss of revenue and brand damage.</p>

<p>This chapter gives you practical industry examples and studies which expose
the effects of performance on the bottom line. If you're not convinced that
speed means money, read on. If you <em>are</em> convinced but your boss or
client needs a proof, this chapter gives you the tools to "sell" performance and
demonstrate that <em>speed</em>, indeed, <em>matters</em>.</p>

<h2>The Negative Effects of Slowing Down</h2>

<p>Determining the relationship between page load time and business objectives
has been a long-standing task for many performance professionals. The way to
demonstrate this relationship would be to use the technique called
<em>split-testing</em> (also known as <em>A/B testing</em> or <em>bucket
testing</em>). You serve a page to a portion (a bucket) of your users, while at
the same time serve a version of the page which looks exactly the same but is
optimized for speed (or intentionally slower) to a different bucket of users.
Then you measure the results - revenue, number of new users, subscriptions,
conversions, or whatever the specific goal of the site may be - in each of the
buckets. Turns out it's not so easy to conduct such experiments in practice. Not
because is technically challenging, but because no one wants to penalize the
users by slowing down their experience or intentionally not implementing a speed
improvement for all users. </p>

<p>Luckily, some big names such as Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft have performed
experiments and shared the data that shows the negative effects of slowing down
pages.</p>

<h3>A Study at Bing</h3>

<p>Microsoft's live.com was just about to relaunch as the redesigned and
rebranded bing.com. Since the old site was going away, Microsoft's researchers
took the opportunity to perform an experiment. The experiment was slowing down
the search result pages artificially before they were sent to the user.</p>

<p>They slowed down the page by various amounts from 50 milliseconds all the way
to 2 seconds. The results showed a clear negative impact of the slower
experience on all measured metrics - revenue, time to click, user satisfaction
and others (<b>Figure 1.1.</b>)</p>

<p>

  changes.</div>
</p>

<p>In Microsoft's tests, the negative impact was changing roughly linearly to
the amount of delay: the slower the page, the worse it got. They also noted that
the "Time to Click" measurement was roughly double the artificial delay. That
means that if your page is 1 second slower than it could be, your users will
wait 2 more seconds before they interact with that page. During this time they
might get distracted by other tasks or a phone ringing for example and never
complete the task you would like them to.</p>

<p>And finally, talking about money, Microsoft's experiment showed that a
one-second delay meant about 3% less revenue, while a two second delay reduced
revenue by over 4%.</p>

<h3>Google's Case</h3>

<p>Similar experiments were done at Google and Yahoo! Search where the search
results pages were artificially delayed. These experiments showed similar
results. </p>

<p>Google's experiment in particular highlighted two additional points:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The negative effect on business metrics <em>gets worse with time</em>. The
  users may tolerate the slower page during first few visits but will then
  search increasingly less and even abandon the site.</li> <li>The second point
  is that even after removing the delay and ending the experiment, things didn't
  just immediately get back to normal. There was an <em>after-effect</em> of the
  experiment. Some of the users left the site for good, they moved to the
  competition and didn't return. This is why improving performance is important
  and also why testing with artificial delays is tricky and not recommended for
  longer periods of time.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Yahoo!'s Case</h3>

<p>While the previous studies were only search-related, the negative impact of
slow pages applies to most other types of pages and sites.</p>

<p>Another experiment was done at Yahoo! with a portal type of page. As soon as
the page was delayed by 0.4 seconds, there was a <em>drop in the full-page
traffic</em> of anywhere between 5% and 9% (depending on browser and user's
connection speed). Drop in full-page traffic means that users were leaving the
page before it loaded completely (before the <code>onload</code> event fires).
Users were either hitting the <strong>Back</strong> button or clicking away from
the page refusing to wait for it to load.</p>

<h3>AOL's Study</h3>

<p>At AOL, the performance researchers performed another study: this time not
using artificial delays, but simply plotting the relation between the speed of a
page and the amount of traffic it gets.</p>

<p>The results, shown on <b>Figure 1.2.</b>, show that there's a clear
connection: the slower the page, the fewer views it gets during a user's
visit.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p><b>Figure 1.2.</b> shows the results for one of AOL's properties called
Moviefone, but similar results were observed across the other measured
properties: AOL Money and Finance, AOL Sports, and AOL Shopping.</p>

<h2>The Positive Effects of Speeding Up</h2>

<p>While the previous examples demonstrated the devastating effects of slowing
down pages, it's even more interesting to see what happens when you successfully
improve page load times.</p>

<h3>60 Million More Downloads a Year</h3>

<p>Mozilla's website has several dedicated <em>landing pages</em> for users
interested in downloading Firefox. One of the most popular is a page designed
for Internet Explorer users to download Firefox. This is a good case where one
might think that page load time doesn't matter all that much. After all, if you
end up on a download page, you've most likely already decided to download. Turns
out this is not the case.</p>

<p>Developers at Mozilla succeeded in speeding up the page by an average of 2.2
seconds, then used A/B testing and measured the two versions of the same page
served to different users. The results were staggering: on the faster page
<strong>conversions increased by 15.4%</strong>. That translates to over 10
million more downloads a year. After performing similar optimizations on the
other top landing pages, Mozilla estimates 60 million more downloads per year,
just because of improved page loading speed - with no other changes to the
page's design or functionality. </p>

<h3>Shopzilla</h3>

<p>The e-commerce site shopzilla.com also reported impressive benefits from
speeding up their web site. After they rebuilt their site focusing on
performance, the page loading times went from around 6 seconds down to 1.2
seconds. As a result a number of important metrics improved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conversion rates increased by 7 to 12%</li> <li>Page views increased by
  25%</li> <li>The paid search traffic (from Search Engine Marketing) increased
  by 8% in the US and 120% in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>At the same time, as a side effect of the performance improvements, they were
able to reduce their costs of operation. The required infrastructure to support
the site was cut in half and the estimated cost for each release dropped from
thousands of dollars down to $80. </p>

<p>In other words they saved money while at the same time making more money.</p>

<h3>Speed and SEO</h3>

<p>In April 2010 Google announced that page speed has become one of the ranking
factors in the order of displaying search results. Since Google's aim is to
serve the best results to the user, in this case they act as advocates to the
user. Given two pages that offer the same quality of matches to the user's query
string, Google will display the faster one higher in the list of results,
because this is actually the page that the user would prefer to see if given a
choice.</p>

<p>This means that performance is now an essential part of any SEO (Search
Engine Optimization) effort. And everything you've read about the importance of
SEO also applies to performance optimization.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
  <h4>SEM</h4> <p>SEM (Search Engine Marketing) is a catch-all term encompassing
  both optimizing the site for placement in the "organic" (unpaid) search
  results as well as placement in the sponsored listings which are usually on
  the top, bottom and right-hand side of search results (<b>Figure 1.3.</b>). As
  mentioned already, page speed affects Google's organic results since April
  2010. But even before that, since 2008, page speed has been a factor in
  Google's sponsored listings (AdWords). If the landing page after clicking on
  an AdWords link loads faster, it is graded higher and it will be displayed
  further up in the list of sponsored links. The Shopzilla study is a proof of
  the SEM improvement in action.</p>

<h2>Speed is a Feature</h2>

<p>Page loading times affect the bottom line, the user satisfaction and
happiness, SEO and many other factors for the success of a web site. It is
therefore critical to no longer consider performance as an afterthought, a
nice-to-have or a part of the post-launch activities. </p>

<p>The best strategy is to consider speed as a feature just like one of the
other features and cool widgets on your site.</p>

<h3>A Requirement</h3>

<p>Fred Wilson is a well-known VC (venture capitalist) and investor in companies
such as Twitter, del.icio.us and Zynga. When he gives advice to startups, he
puts speed as the number one in his "10 Golden Principles of Successful Web
Apps". The companies in his portfolio are being monitored for loading speed and
are checked on a weekly basis. VC's have noticed that if a company's web site
slows down, that usually coincides with slowing down the growth of the company's
business.</p>

<p>In his own words at the "Future of Web Apps" conference in 2010: "There is
real empirical evidence that substantiates the fact that speed is more than a
feature. It's a requirement."</p>

<h3>Google's #1 Feature</h3>

<p>The reason Google includes page loading time in search rankings, both paid
and unpaid, is because they've noticed the effects of speed while building their
own web sites. They claim that speed has been a differentiator since the very
beginning of Google search. They've noticed the negative effects of slowing
down, the positive effects of speeding up, and have reportedly established speed
as the most important feature of any product they build.</p>

<p>Consider these two quotes that illustrate Google's position on building sites
and applications optimized for speed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>"As a product manager you should know that speed is product feature
  number one."</em><br>
      Larry Page, founder of Google, quoted by Urs H&#246;lzle at Velocity
      conference 2010</li>
  <li><em>"Never underestimate the importance of fast"</em><br>
      CEO Eric Schmidt announcing Google Instant in September 2010</li>
</ul>
